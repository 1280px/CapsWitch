# Switchy-mod
A simple program that switches keyboard layout with the CapsLock key — just put it in the Startup folder (press **Win+R** and type <code>shell:startup</code> to open) and enjoy!

> Note: for keyboard layout switching to work in programs running with administrator privileges, Switchy must also be run with administrator privileges. This can be done using Task Scheduler.

**Supported systems:** [Windows XP (x86)](https://github.com/1280px/Switchy-mod/releases/download/m1.1/Switchy-mod-XP.exe), [Windows 7–11 (x64)](https://github.com/1280px/Switchy-mod/releases/download/m1.1/Switchy-mod-64.exe)



## Usage:
* **CapsLock** to change keyboard layout  
* **Shift+CapsLock / CapsLock+Shift** to toggle CapsLock state
* **Alt+CapsLock** to enable/disable Switchy ***(disabled in mod)***


In original Switchy, language switcher pop-up is enabled by default and you have to use <code>/nopopup</code> parameter to remove it.

This behaviour is ***disabled*** in the mod; use <code>/showpopup</code> in you want to get it back, for whatever reason.
