# Switchy-mod
A simple program that switches keyboard layout with the CapsLock key — just put it in the Startup folder (press **Win+R** and type <code>shell:startup</code> to open)!

**Supported systems:** Windows XP, Windows 7–Windows 11

In the modded version, the language switcher pop-up is disabled by default; If you want to get it back, for whatever reason, put in this folder a shortcut with **/showpopup** parameter instead of the file itself.

> Note: for keyboard layout switching to work in programs running with administrator privileges, Switchy must also be run with administrator privileges. This can be done using Task Scheduler.


### Usage:
* **CapsLock** to change keyboard layout  
* **Shift+CapsLock / CapsLock+Shift** to toggle CapsLock state
* **Alt+CapsLock** to enable/disable Switchy ***(disabled in modded version!)***
