# CapsWitch üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è
A simple and lightweight program that switches keyboard layout with the CapsLock key ‚Äî just put it in the Startup folder (press **Win+R** and type <code>shell:startup</code> to open) and enjoy!

> **Note**: For keyboard layout switching to work in programs running with administrator privileges, CapsWitch must also be run with administrator privileges. This can be done, in example, [using Task Scheduler](https://youtu.be/jt1Eb-NaBeg). <br>CapsWitch can also run without privileges elevation, however it will only work in other non-elevated programs.

## Use it!
The program works by emulating specific language switch combination (Alt+Shift by default, but can be configured in settings) whenever Caps Lock key is pressed. The controls are:

+ **CapsLock** to change keyboard layout  
+ **Shift+CapsLock / CapsLock+Shift** to toggle CapsLock state
+ **Alt+CapsLock** to enable/disable *(only works if enabled in settings)*


## Configure it!
CapsWitch allows some customization using .ini settings file. By default, it looks for ```CapsWitch.ini``` file in the same directory, however you can pass custom file (with path) using agruments (e.g. ```.\CapsWitch.exe "C:\test.ini"```). The program can also work without .ini file, simply using default settings values.

*You can see more information about each option [in default .ini file](https://github.com/1280px/CapsWitch/blob/master/CapsWitch.ini).*
