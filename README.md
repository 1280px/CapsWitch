# Switchy-mod
Switches keyboard layout with the Caps Lock key.

Just put [Switchy.exe](https://github.com/1280px/Switchy/releases/download/m1.0/Switchy.exe) in the Startup folder (to open it press **Win+R** and type **shell:startup**).

In this mod, the language switcher pop-up is disabled by default; If you want to get it back, for whatever reason, put in this folder a shortcut with **/showpopup** parameter instead of the file itself.

> Note: for keyboard layout switching to work in programs running with administrator privileges, Switchy must also be run with administrator privileges. This can be done using Task Scheduler.

Usage:
* **CapsLock** to change keyboard layout  
* **Shift+CapsLock / CapsLock+Shift** to toggle CapsLock state
* ~~**Alt+CapsLock** to enable/disable Switchy~~
