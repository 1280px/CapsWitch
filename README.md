# Switchy
Switches languages by the Caps Lock key.

Just put [Switchy.exe](https://github.com/erryox/Switchy/releases) in the startup folder (to open it press **Win+R** and type **shell:startup**).  
If you want to hide the pop-up in Windows 10, put in this folder a shortcut with **nopopup** parameter instead of the file itself.
